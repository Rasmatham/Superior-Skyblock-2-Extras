Tested and verified to work on Minecraft 1.20.X with [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/)

## Installation
0. Build the project (Or check if there is a jar available in [tags](https://github.com/Rasmatham/Superior-Skyblock-2-Extras/tags)/[releases](https://github.com/Rasmatham/Superior-Skyblock-2-Extras/releases))
1. Add the jar to your plugins folder
2. Add the contents of [settings-template.yml](./settings-template.yml) into /plugins/SuperiorSkyblock2/menus/settings.yml (note: You should not copy the settings: line. That's just to show where it's supposed to go in the settings.yml)
3. Make any changes you'd (You might for example want to set some of them as enabled at spawn or by default on the islands by going to /plugins/config.yml and checking out spawn->settings and default-settings)
4. Restart your server
